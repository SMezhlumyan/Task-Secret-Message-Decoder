**Secret Message Decoder**

**Overview**

In this assignment, you'll work with file operations in C to decode a secret message hidden within a text file. The message has been encoded by shifting each character forward by three positions in the alphabet (e.g., 'A' becomes 'D', 'Z' becomes 'C'). Your task is to write a C program that decodes this message and writes the decoded text back to the same file.

**Objectives**

1. **Read Encoded Characters**: Use `pread()` to read characters from specified offsets in the encoded file.
2. **Decode Characters**: Implement a function to shift each character back by three positions in the alphabet to its original form.
3. **Write Decoded Characters**: Use `pwrite()` to overwrite the encoded characters with the decoded characters directly in the file.
4. **Efficient File Navigation**: Optionally use `lseek()` to explore more about file navigation though it's not necessary with `pread()` and `pwrite()`.

**Requirements**

- The program must read an encoded file, decode its content, and write the decoded characters back to the same file.
- The program should launch and display instructions or a prompt for the user to input the path to the encoded file and the specific offsets where encoded characters are located.
- Decode each character by shifting it back by 3 positions in the alphabet.
- Use `pwrite()` to overwrite the encoded characters with the decoded ones directly at the same offsets in the file.
- Display the decoded message once all specified offsets are processed.
- Ensure the program can handle multiple decoding sessions one after another without needing to restart.
